# Learning French

## Background
Montréal is an amazing place where people can fluentely switch between French and English.  It surprised me when I first stopped by Vancouver airport and found some French words in Canada.  Later, I knew Canada is bilinguistic country which supports two official languages: English and French.  It won't surprise me any more when I see English along with French.  On the other hand, I try to find the similarity between two languages.

I recalled my memory in my hometown, Wenzhou, where I grew up in a bilingustic culture.  Regarding to local dialect, it is an enclave in the south of Zhejiang Province (next to Shanghai).  I met many friends from other cities in this province in my undergraduate study and none could even understand a little about my dialect, Wenzhou Hua (温州话).  It is fantastic to encode the language for the communication between Wenzhounese.  Actually, we speak both Mandarin and Wenzhou Hua in local area.  Especially, when you take a bus to somewhere, you definitely hear Wenzhou Hua first, then Mandarin.

Unlike French, there is no literal characters for Wenzhou Hua, instead we just inherent from daily communication.  About 8 years ago, local people realized the importance of the reserve of the language heritage, because young generation spends much time on study in school where Mandarin is mandatory.  Fortuantely, we founded TV channels and broadcast to advocate people to use Wenzhou Hua more in daily life.


## How to Study
There are multiple ways can study French.  I prefer to accumulate French words in an easy way since I am in Montreal now.

- Collect words you meet in supermarket, drugstore, metro, restaurant and etc.
