## Array Theory and the Design of Nial


## The beauty of computation

Chapter 15: Numerical computation

- **Pro:** I think this chapter is your expertise.
- **Con:** The origanization of example code can be improved.

Chapter 16: Relational Databases

- **Pro:** Give an interesting database example
- **Con:** Too short, maybe you can mention Postgre whose inventor, [Michael Stonbraker](http://amturing.acm.org/), won the Turing Award last year.

I like your last photo on fishing.  From your short biography, I learn two points:

1. Your research focus on both mathematics and computer science and APL/QNIAL is a natural choice for you.
2. Queen's computer science department started in 1970 (fourty-five years ago).
