## What is ELI?

ELI is an array programming language system derived from APL but uses ACSII characters for easy
communication. ELI has almost all functionalities of ISO APL [1], i.e. all flat array operations, but it also has features not prescribed in [1] such as complex number, symbol, temporal data, list, dictionary, table, esql, control structures and scripting files. We kept ELI simple since we want to make a clean and succinct way of doing array computing, unburdened by the legacy of FORTRAN, accessible to the general public. We make such a tool freely available to let more people appreciate the fact that simplicity of rules and notation in a programming language leads to greater programming productivity.

## Eli Primer

The Primer is short; it is neither a tutorial nor a reference manual but does cover most material in the current ELI system. A careful reading of this Primer should enable a newcomer to get sufficiently familiar with ELI to start using it. Thus, anyone with basic mathematics background can quickly pick up ELI to explore programming with arrays.

## Eli Project

Currently, ELI is available on Microsoft Windows platform as well as on Linux and Mac OS. The
directory structures are different in Windows and Linux/Mac OS. On Windows, under the directory eli, there are two subdirectories bin (which contains the eli.exe and documents) and ws (which contains workspaces and script files). On Linux/Mac OS these two are merged into one directory elix/elim. The user interface under Windows, Linux and Mac is through an ELI window under ELI Studio in release version 0.3 of ELI; previously it was line based for Linux/Mac.

The project started around 2000 [2] but was dormant for almost a decade; during 2009-2012 ELI has been revived with new features such as lists, complex numbers and temporal data, and made publicly available in 2011 (current site: http://fastarray.appspot.com/). In 2013, we added dictionaries and tables as well as esql. Both developers reside in North America since the fall of 2012. We welcome suggestions and comments from users around the world to further improve ELI.
