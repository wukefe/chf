# Arrays, Primitive Functions and Operators

## Getting started

You get an ELI executable, eli.exe, either through an e-mail or download from the web. You put eli.exe on
your desktop or some directory in my document. Click on eli.exe icon and you see

```q
ELI version 0.3 (C) Rapidsoft
      CLEAR WS
```

You type (the lines displayed with an indentation), and you see the system responses with a line:

```q
      !10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
      100+!10
101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110
      v<-100+!10
      v
101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110
      w<-2*v
      w
202 204 206 208 210 212 214 216 218 220
      2*100+!10
202 204 206 208 210 212 214 216 218 220
      w+v
303 306 309 312 315 318 321 324 327 330
      v+w<-2*v<-100+!10
303 306 309 312 315 318 321 324 327 330
```

First, `!` is a function which, when applied to n generates a vector from 1 to n. 100 is then added to each
element in that vector. This vector can then be assigned to a variable v , and after multiplying by 2 we store the
value in another variable w , whose value can also be generated by the line below (in that line + is done before
`*` because `+` is to the right of `*`). We see here two basic principles in ELI:

1. ** a line executes from right to left and all functions have equal precedence; **
2. ** for an arithmetic function f, A f B works if either one of the operands is a single or both are of
equal shape (length).**
