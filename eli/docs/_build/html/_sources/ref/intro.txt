This is a reference manual for ELI programming language. For more information about ELI, please visit `fastarray <http://fastarray.appspot.com/default.html>`_ and `wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELI_(programming_language)>`_.

Unlike APL, ELI uses ASCII characters.  ELI has one or two ASCII characters to denote one APL notation.  Normally, the second character is a dot(.) which extends a function to another similar function.  For example, in terms of dyadic functions, the Asterisk(``*``) is the *multiplication* and the ``*.`` is the *power*.  This design helps ELI programmers quickly grasp the language with rich primitives.

ELI is a succinct and powerful array programming language.  You don't need to write loops for iterating every element in arrays. Instead, the set of well-designed primitives can take over the loops so that programmers are freed from tedious labor work and use ELI as a tool of thought.
